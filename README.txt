
Introduction
-------------

ATTILA is GPU simulator with OpenGL and D3D9 API implementations that can be used
to simulate PC Windows game traces.

In the ATTILA source code included in this package you will find the classes used
to build the simulator, the API implementations to run OpenGL and D3D9 game traces
on this simulator, the API trace tools and a number of tools that had been used on
the development of this project.

Some of the techniques and algorithms implemented in the simulator may be covered
by patents (for example DXTC/S3TC compression or the Z compression algorithm).
